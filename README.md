# Exercises for Ã…bo Akademi course Parallel Programming (IT00CD91)

The task was to calculate angles between galaxies to determine whether there is evidence about dark matter. More detailed explanation about the exercise is in the Darkmatter.pdf.

There is implementations with three different techonlogies: OpenMP, MPI and CUDA.

Here is run times of all programs. All were run on dione.utu.fi (which has max 40 cores on single node)

| Name      | Cores | Time (s)  |
| --------- | ----- | --------- |
| OpenMP    | 40    | ~8.5s     |
| MPI       | 100   | ~5s       |
| CUDA      | -     | ~0.5s     |
